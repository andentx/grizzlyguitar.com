## Description

This is a website for [Grizzly Guitar](https://www.grizzlyguitar.com), a boutique guitar service and online store.
<br />
<br />
This project combines many of my interests: Software Engineering, Web Development, Business, Music Gear, and the art of Luthiery - building and repairing stringed musical instruments. I've always dreamed of having my own guitar shop, so when deciding on a project to learn more about building e-commerce websites, a guitar service and online store was the natural choice!
<br />
<br />
My goal with this project is to learn more about different web development tools and technologies, specifically [React](https://react.dev), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). I'm also interested in getting more experience with using [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com), and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) as a CMS. Now that I've built a website that features a blog, content stored in Sanity, and E-Commerce functionality, I'm more interested than ever in learning about how to build accessible, high-performance online store experiences with a modern tech stack.
