## About

This is a website for [Grizzly Guitar](https://www.grizzlyguitar.com), a boutique guitar service and online store.
<br />
<br />
This project combines many of my interests: Web development, business, photography, music gear, and the art of luthiery - building and repairing stringed musical instruments.
<br/>
<br/>
I love to adjust, build, and change things, so naturally I learned how to work on my own guitars. Now that I've been helping and working with other musicians and their instruments, I wanted to set up a website with more information about what I do!
<br />
<br />
Building and maintaining this website has been a great learning experience. I've got familiar with using different Shopify APIs, setting up and customizing Sanity CMS, as well as optimizing performance using a few different data fetching setups.
<br/>
